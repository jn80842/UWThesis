\label{chapter:conclusion}

We claim in this work that formal methods and program synthesis can be used to assist compiler authors in creating and maintaining these term rewriting systems. In prior work, we have shown how these techniques can aid in the maintenance of existing term rewriting systems by providing proofs of correctness and termination, and by synthesizing rewrite rules that strengthen a system's reasoning power. In proposed work, we plan to show how our techniques can greatly improve smaller or immature term rewriting systems or even create them from scratch. We have demonstrated the former claim in a case study on the Halide simplifier term rewriting system, and have presented a plan to investigate the latter claim on the variable solver, a much less mature term rewriting system in the Halide compiler.
